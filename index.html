    <title>The Boy Wonder!</title>
    <h1>I am Jerry Lay and this is my personal website!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hello everyone! I am Jerry Lay and I attend the University at Buffalo. This is my personal website where I like to talk a little about myself. I am currently 18 in my first semester of college, WOO!. College has been amazing so far but there has been loads of work. Coming from a small town, Buffalo fulfills my expectations and is a major change. There are differences between a large city and a small town but I've come to like them both equally. My high school class only consisted of around 150 which is pretty small compared to city schools. I loved high school as it's where I mainly grew and learned skills that assisted me with college. Back at home, I had plenty of friends but mainly interacted with this small group which I kept very close. My close group of friends shared the same hobbies as I: video games, movies, chillin, etc. I really am a typical guy with a typical backstory but I guess everyone's the same to an extent.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Well a little more detail on my life. As I said in the previous paragraph, I am a typical guy. Although there are small things that seem to distinguish me such as free time thinking. Sometime's I'll be zoned out thinking about the most random things such as what if this happened. It happen's regardless of what I'm doing so I guess it's not really free time thinking is it. Anyways I do enjoy this type of thinking as it's a mix between daydreaming and just plain thinking. I do enjoy looking at the smallest things such as this webpage. If I opened a webpage with similar background colors, I would probably say "Wow look at these colors... Hey guys look at this webpage isn't it nice!" I always seem to take the smallest things further than it should. I just realized this paragraph has literally nothing to do with my life and I just went on about nothing. The guidelines for this webpage did say that it should be informative and attractive and I think this adds a little confused chuckle in there. Well anyways I come from a small town about an hour away from Rochester. I've lived there my whole life while also living in other areas for a little more than half my life. If you're confused from the previous sentence then I see why. My parents were divorced since I was six years old and my mom has lived in a different town since around eight years. I've pretty much split my time between each parents. Pretty much every other week is the opposite parent. Life as I grew up became normal that way moving from house to house pretty much all the time. Also divorce does create a good memoir for senior year. I really don't know what else to say that's pretty generic. CSE 199 was pretty neat as it was different than any other class I have taken. It was a great experience and I hope you guys have a good one!
