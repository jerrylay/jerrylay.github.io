    <h1>I am Jerry Lay and this is my personal website!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Hello everyone! I am Jerry Lay and I attend the University at Buffalo. This is my personal website where I like to talk a little about myself. I am currently 18 in my first semester of college, WOO!. College has been amazing so far but there has been loads of work. Coming from a small town, Buffalo fulfills my expectations and is a major change. There are differences between a large city and a small town but I've come to like them both equally. My high school class only consisted of around 150 which is pretty small compared to city schools. I loved high school as it's where I mainly grew and learned skills that assisted me with college. Back at home, I had plenty of friends but mainly interacted with this small group which I kept very close. My close group of friends shared the same hobbies as I: video games, movies, chillin, etc. I really am a typical guy with a typical backstory but I guess everyone's the same to an extent.</p>
